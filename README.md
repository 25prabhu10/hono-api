# REST API

This is a REST API template built with [Hono](https://hono.dev/) and used [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for database operations.

This is a REST API template copied from [w3cj/hono-open-api-starter](https://github.com/w3cj/hono-open-api-starter). Created a new repository to learn instead of forking the original repository.

## Frameworks and Libraries

- [Hono](https://hono.dev/): Fast, lightweight, built on Web Standards. Support for any JavaScript runtime.
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/): Drizzle ORM is a headless TypeScript ORM with a head.
- [pino.js](https://getpino.io): Very low overhead Node.js logger
- [Scalar](https://scalar.com/): The modern open-source developer experience platform for your APIs.
